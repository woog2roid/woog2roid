## GuiJung Woo (woog2roid)

### A developer 
who believes great services can enrich our lives  
who values efficient operation of an organization  
who derives pleasure from exploring new technology

As mentioned above, I am interested in creating great services, and I am open to learning skills are required in the process. And I have deployed projects so far on my personal domain(woog2roid.dev). As developed several web services, I naturally came to study the web full stack.

Currently I want to expand knowledge and experience to the overall field. To achieve this, I am participating in several projects with AI researcher/developer, designer, PM.
