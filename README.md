Hi, I'm GuiJung Woo. As explained above, I am interested in creating great services itself, and I am open to learning whatever skills are needed in the process. As developed several web services, I naturally came to study the web full stack. And I have been deploying projects so far through my personal domain(woog2roid.dev). Currently, I am very interested in the backend and DevOps, but I still want to expand my knowledge by experiencing as much as possible as I can as an undergraduate.
