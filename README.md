# GuiJung Woo (woog2roid)

I am interested in creating great services, and I am open to learning skills are required in the process. And I have deployed projects on my personal domain(woog2roid.dev). As developed several web services, I came to study to understand the full-stack web development pipeline. Currently I want to expand knowledge and experience to the overall field.
