### **_"A man who believes great services can enrich our lives"_**

> _I am interested in creating great services. And I am open to learning skills required in the process. The skills mean not only computer science but also soft skills such as team management, cooperation, service itself, etc. I also write down my experiences in my [blog](https://woo2groid.dev) for recording my growth._
